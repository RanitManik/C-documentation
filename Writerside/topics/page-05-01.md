# Basic Operators

Operators in C are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Here is an overview of basic operators in C:

## 1. **Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numerical values.

- **Addition (`+`):** Adds two operands.

  ```c
  int result = 5 + 3;  // Result is 8
  ```

- **Subtraction (`-`):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.

  ```c
  int result = 10 - 4;  // Result is 6
  ```

- **Multiplication (`*`):** Multiplies two operands.

  ```c
  int result = 3 * 7;  // Result is 21
  ```

- **Division (`/`):** Divides the left operand by the right operand.

  ```c
  float result = 15.0 / 2.0;  // Result is 7.5
  ```

- **Modulus (`%`):** Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.

  ```c
  int result = 10 % 3;  // Result is 1
  ```

## 2. **Assignment Operator**

The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.

```c
int num = 42;  // Assigns the value 42 to the variable 'num'
```

## 3. **Comparison Operators**

Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result (`true` or `false`).

- **Equal to (`==`):** Checks if two values are equal.

  ```c
  int a = 5, b = 5;
  if (a == b) {
      // Code executed if 'a' is equal to 'b'
  }
  ```

- **Not equal to (`!=`):** Checks if two values are not equal.

  ```c
  int x = 10, y = 20;
  if (x != y) {
      // Code executed if 'x' is not equal to 'y'
  }
  ```

- **Greater than (`>`):** Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

- **Less than (`<`):** Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

- **Greater than or equal to (`>=`):** Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

- **Less than or equal to (`<=`):** Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

## 4. **Logical Operators**

Logical operators perform logical operations and return a Boolean result.

- **Logical AND (`&&`):** Returns `true` if both operands are `true`.

- **Logical OR (`||`):** Returns `true` if at least one operand is `true`.

- **Logical NOT (`!`):** Returns `true` if the operand is `false`, and vice versa.

```c
int age = 25;
if (age >= 18 && age <= 30) {
    // Code executed if age is between 18 and 30
}
```
