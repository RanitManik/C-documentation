# Overview

File Input and Output (I/O) in C is essential for reading from and writing to external files. This page provides an
overview of how file operations are performed in C programming.

## **File Pointers**

- File operations in C involve the use of file pointers, which are variables that hold the memory address of the file
  being accessed.

    ```c
    FILE *filePointer;
    ```

## **Opening a File**

- To open a file, use the `fopen` function. It requires the file path and the mode in which the file is opened (read,
  write, etc.).

    ```c
    filePointer = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    ```

## **Closing a File**

- Always close a file after operations using the `fclose` function. This ensures that resources are released.

    ```c
    fclose(filePointer);
    ```

## **Reading from a File**

- Use functions like `fscanf` or `fgets` to read data from a file.

    ```c
    fscanf(filePointer, "%s", buffer);
    ```

## **Writing to a File**

- Use functions like `fprintf` or `fputs` to write data to a file.

    ```c
    fprintf(filePointer, "Hello, World!\n");
    ```

## **Error Handling**

- Check if file operations are successful by verifying the return values of file functions.

    ```c
    if (filePointer == NULL) {
        // Handle error
    }
    ```

## **File Modes**

- Different modes dictate the type of file operations. Common modes include:
- `"r"` - Read
- `"w"` - Write (creates or truncates file)
- `"a"` - Append (creates or appends to file)
- `"r+"` - Read and Write
- `"w+"` - Read and Write (creates or truncates file)

## **Binary Files**

- File I/O can be performed in binary mode (`"rb"`, `"wb"`, etc.) for non-text files.

    ```c
    filePointer = fopen("binaryfile.bin", "rb");
    ```

Understanding file operations is crucial for handling data persistence in C. Whether reading data from a file, writing
to it, or performing a combination of both, these file I/O operations enable efficient handling of external data.
