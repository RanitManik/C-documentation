# Constant Strings in C

In C programming, constant strings are represented as string literals, which are sequences of characters enclosed in
double quotes. These string literals are often referred to as constant strings because, by default, they are read-only
and should not be modified. Let's explore the characteristics and usage of constant strings in C.

## String Literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. When used to initialize a character array, it
creates a constant string.

```c
const char *greeting = "Hello, World!";
```

In this example, `greeting` is a pointer to a constant string. The `const` keyword indicates that the string is
read-only, and attempting to modify it may result in undefined behavior.

## Characteristics of Constant Strings

1. **Read-Only:**
    - String literals are read-only by default.
    - Modifying the characters of a string literal is undefined behavior.

2. **Storage in Read-Only Memory:**
    - String literals are often stored in read-only memory.
    - Attempting to modify a string literal can lead to a runtime error.

3. **Initialization at Compile Time:**
    - String literals are typically initialized at compile time.

## Usage of Constant Strings

Constant strings are commonly used for:

- **Message Printing:**
  ```c
  printf("Error: File not found\n");
  ```

- **Function Parameters:**
  ```c
  void printMessage(const char *message) {
      printf("%s\n", message);
  }
  ```

- **Array Initialization:**
  ```c
  const char vowels[] = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', '\0'};
  ```

- **Command-Line Arguments:**
  ```c
  int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
      // Access command-line arguments
      // ...
  }
  ```

## Modification Attempts

Attempting to modify a constant string can lead to unexpected behavior. The following code is incorrect:

```c
const char *greeting = "Hello";
greeting[0] = 'J'; // Incorrect: Modifying a constant string
```

To avoid this, it's recommended to use character arrays for strings that need to be modified:

```c
char mutableString[] = "Hello";
mutableString[0] = 'J'; // Correct: Modifying a non-constant string
```

## Conclusion

Constant strings, defined as string literals, play a crucial role in C programming for representing read-only text.
Understanding their characteristics and adhering to the read-only nature is essential for writing robust and error-free
C code.
