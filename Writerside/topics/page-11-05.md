# Pointers and Const

Understanding the use of `const` with pointers is crucial for creating robust and secure C programs. This section
explores how `const` can be applied to pointers and the implications it has on both the pointers and the data they point
to.

## **Constant Pointers**

- A constant pointer is declared using the `const` keyword. It implies that the pointer itself cannot be reassigned to
  point to a different memory address:

    ```c
    int number = 42;
    int *const constantPointer = &number; // Constant pointer to an integer
    ```

The address stored in `constantPointer` cannot be changed once initialized.

## **Pointer to Constant Data**

- A pointer to constant data is declared by placing `const` before the data type. This implies that the value pointed to
  by the pointer cannot be modified through the pointer:

    ```c
    const int *pointerToConstantData;
    ```

Here, `pointerToConstantData` is a pointer that can be reassigned to different memory addresses, but the data it points
to cannot be modified.

## **Constant Pointer to Constant Data**

- You can combine `const` for both the pointer and the data it points to:

    ```c
    const int *const constantPointerToConstantData;
    ```

This creates a constant pointer to constant data, ensuring both the pointer and the data remain unmodifiable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Constant Pointer

   ```c
   // Declaration and Initialization of a Constant Pointer
   int value = 99;
   int *const constantPointer = &value;
   ```

### Example 2: Pointer to Constant Data

   ```c
   // Declaration of a Pointer to Constant Data
   const double *temperaturePointer;
   ```

### Example 3: Constant Pointer to Constant Data

   ```c
   // Declaration of a Constant Pointer to Constant Data
   const char *const constantPointerToConstantString = "Hello, World!";
   ```

Understanding how to use `const` with pointers provides enhanced control over data manipulation and prevents unintended
modifications. It's a valuable tool for ensuring program integrity.
