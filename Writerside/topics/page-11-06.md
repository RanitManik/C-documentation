# Void Pointers

Void pointers (`void *`) in C are versatile pointers that can point to objects of any data type. They provide a
mechanism for handling generic data without specifying a particular type. This section explores the use of void pointers
and how they can be employed in various scenarios.

## **Declaration of Void Pointers**

- Void pointers are declared using the `void` keyword as the data type:

    ```c
    void *genericPointer;
    ```

This creates a void pointer named `genericPointer` capable of pointing to objects of any type.

## **Example of Using Void Pointers**

- Void pointers are often employed in dynamic memory allocation scenarios, where the data type may not be known
  beforehand:

    ```c
    int integerValue = 42;
    char charValue = 'A';
    double doubleValue = 3.14;

    void *pointerToData;

    // Pointing to an integer
    pointerToData = &integerValue;

    // Pointing to a character
    pointerToData = &charValue;

    // Pointing to a double
    pointerToData = &doubleValue;
    ```

Here, `pointerToData` can be assigned the address of variables of different types.

## **Dereferencing Void Pointers**

- Dereferencing void pointers requires typecasting to the appropriate data type:

    ```c
    int integerValue = 42;
    void *pointerToData = &integerValue;

    // Dereferencing with typecasting
    int value = *((int *)pointerToData);
    ```

The `(int *)` typecast is used to interpret the void pointer as a pointer to an integer.

Understanding void pointers is essential for scenarios where the data type may vary, such as in generic data structures
or dynamic memory management.
