# Errors and Warnings

In the process of coding, it's common to encounter various types of errors and warnings. Understanding these errors and
knowing how to address them is crucial for a smooth programming experience. Let's explore the different types of errors
and how to handle them.

## Compiler Errors

Compiler errors occur during the compilation process when the compiler finds issues in your code that prevent it from
generating executable code. These errors must be fixed before proceeding. Let's look at an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Suppose you forget to include the necessary header file (`#include <stdio.h>`). The compiler would generate an error
like this:

```
hello.c:1:10: fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found
#include <stdio.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.
```

To solve this, ensure that you include the required header files and fix any syntax errors reported by the compiler.

## Compiler Warnings

Compiler warnings are messages that indicate potential issues in your code but don't necessarily prevent compilation.
While your code may compile, addressing warnings is good practice to avoid unexpected behavior. An example warning:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x;
    printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

The compiler might issue a warning about the uninitialized variable `x`:

```
warning: ‘x’ is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
     printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
```

To address this, initialize variables before using them to avoid potential runtime issues.

## Linker Errors

Linker errors occur during the linking phase, which follows compilation. These errors indicate problems with combining
multiple object files into a single executable. Consider the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printMessage();
    return 0;
}
```

If you forget to implement the `printMessage` function, you might encounter a linker error:

```
undefined reference to `printMessage'
```

To resolve this, ensure all function declarations have corresponding implementations, and include the necessary source
files in the compilation process.

## Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program and can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. Common examples
include dividing by zero or accessing an array out of bounds. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};
    printf("%d\n", arr[5]);
    return 0;
}
```

Attempting to access an element beyond the array's bounds results in undefined behavior and a potential runtime error.

To prevent runtime errors, validate user inputs, check array indices, and handle potential exceptions.

## Logic Errors

Logic errors are more subtle and occur when the code doesn't produce the expected output due to flawed logic. These
errors won't generate compiler or runtime errors but can lead to incorrect program behavior. Let's illustrate with an
example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 10;
    int result = x + y;

    // Incorrect logic: should subtract instead of add
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

To fix logic errors, review your code for incorrect algorithms or mathematical operations.
