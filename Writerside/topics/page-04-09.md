# Command Line Arguments

Command line arguments allow a C program to accept inputs directly from the command line when it is executed. These
arguments provide a flexible way to pass information to a program without requiring user interaction during runtime.

## Using Command Line Arguments

In C, the `main` function can receive command line arguments through its parameters. The standard signature for
the `main` function that accepts command line arguments is:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Code that uses command line arguments
    return 0;
}
```

Here, `argc` (argument count) represents the number of command line arguments, and `argv` (argument vector) is an array
of strings containing the actual arguments.

## Example: Printing Command Line Arguments

Let's create a simple program that prints the command line arguments.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Check if there are any command line arguments
    if (argc > 1) {
        // Print each argument
        for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
            printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
        }
    } else {
        printf("No command line arguments provided.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program checks if there are any command line arguments. If arguments are present, it iterates
through them and prints each one along with its position.

## Running the Program

To run the program with command line arguments, compile it and provide the arguments after the executable name.

```bash
./program_name arg1 arg2 arg3
```

In the above command, `program_name` is the name of the compiled executable, and `arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3` are the command
line arguments.

## Conclusion

Command line arguments provide a means for C programs to receive input directly from the command line, enabling more
dynamic and versatile interactions. This capability is especially useful for scripts, utilities, and applications that
need to adapt to different scenarios based on user inputs.
