# Structures Overview

Structures in C allow you to group together variables of different data types under a single name. They provide a way to represent real-world entities more effectively. Let's explore how to create and use structures:

## 1. **Structure Definition**
- To define a structure, use the `struct` keyword, followed by the structure name and a list of member variables.

    ```c
    struct Person {
        char name[50];
        int age;
        float height;
    };
    ```

This defines a structure named `Person` with three members: `name` (a character array), `age` (an integer), and `height` (a floating-point number).

## 2. **Structure Declaration**
- After defining a structure, you can declare variables of that type.

    ```c
    struct Person person1, person2;
    ```

Here, `person1` and `person2` are variables of the `Person` structure.

## 3. **Accessing Structure Members**
- Use the dot (`.`) operator to access structure members.

    ```c
    strcpy(person1.name, "John Doe");
    person1.age = 25;
    person1.height = 5.9;
    ```

## 4. **Initializing Structures**
- Structures can be initialized during declaration.

    ```c
    struct Person person3 = {"Alice Wonderland", 30, 5.5};
    ```

## 5. **Passing Structures to Functions**
- You can pass structures to functions by value or by reference.

    ```c
    void displayPerson(struct Person p) {
        printf("Name: %s\n", p.name);
        printf("Age: %d\n", p.age);
        printf("Height: %.2f\n", p.height);
    }
    ```

## 6. **Arrays of Structures**
- You can create arrays of structures to represent a collection of entities.

    ```c
    struct Person people[3] = {{"Bob Smith", 22, 6.1},
                               {"Eve Johnson", 28, 5.8},
                               {"Charlie Brown", 35, 5.11}};
    ```

## 7. **Nested Structures**
- Structures can be nested within other structures.

    ```c
    struct Address {
        char street[50];
        char city[30];
        int zipCode;
    };

    struct Employee {
        char name[50];
        int empID;
        struct Address address;
    };
    ```

Here, `Employee` structure contains another structure, `Address`.

Structures provide a powerful way to organize and manipulate complex data in C. They enhance code readability and maintainability by grouping related information together.
