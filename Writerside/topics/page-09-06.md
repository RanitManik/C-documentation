# Searching, Tokenizing, and Analyzing Strings

In C programming, searching, tokenizing, and analyzing strings are common tasks performed to manipulate and extract
information from strings. Let's explore these operations and how they can be implemented using C.

## 1. Searching Strings:

Searching for a substring within a string can be done using functions from the `<string.h>` library. The `strstr`
function can be used to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    const char *mainString = "Hello, World!";
    const char *substring = "World";

    // Search for the substring
    char *result = strstr(mainString, substring);

    if (result != NULL) {
        printf("Substring found at index %ld\n", result - mainString);
    } else {
        printf("Substring not found\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program searches for the substring "World" within the main string "Hello, World!" and prints the index where it is
found.

## 2. Tokenizing Strings:

Tokenization involves breaking a string into smaller parts or tokens. The `strtok` function from the `<string.h>`
library can be used for this purpose.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char input[] = "apple,orange,banana";
    const char delimiter[] = ",";

    // Tokenize the string
    char *token = strtok(input, delimiter);

    while (token != NULL) {
        printf("Token: %s\n", token);
        token = strtok(NULL, delimiter);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program tokenizes the input string "apple,orange,banana" using a comma (`,`) as the delimiter and prints each
token.

## 3. Analyzing Strings:

Analyzing strings involves extracting information such as length, counting occurrences, and converting case. Here's an
example that counts the number of occurrences of a specific character:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    const char *text = "programming is fun!";
    char targetChar = 'm';
    int count = 0;

    // Count occurrences of the target character
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(text); i++) {
        if (text[i] == targetChar) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    printf("Occurrences of '%c': %d\n", targetChar, count);

    return 0;
}
```

This program counts the occurrences of the character 'm' in the string "programming is fun!"

These operations provide a foundation for more complex string manipulation tasks. Understanding and combining these
techniques can help in solving various problems related to string handling in C.
