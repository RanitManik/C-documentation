# Overview of C

## Introduction

C is a versatile, imperative programming language designed for structured programming. It excels in state manipulation
through statements, emphasizing how a program changes over time. Today, it stands as one of the most extensively used
programming languages, renowned for its reliability and readability.

## Modern Features

C, despite its inception in 1972, incorporates the essential control structures and features of modern programming
languages. With a focus on top-down planning, C promotes modular design through functions, fostering structured
programming. Its adaptability ranges from minicomputers and Unix/Linux systems to PCs and mainframes.

## Diverse Applications

C serves as the preferred language for various applications, from word processing programs and spreadsheets to
compilers. Notably, it has gained popularity in programming embedded systems, found in automobiles, cameras, DVD
players, and more.

## Role in Linux Development

C has played a pivotal role in the development of Linux. Its programs are not only easy to modify but also readily
adaptable to new models or languages. The language's influence extends to the 1990s when C++ emerged for larger
programming projects, incorporating object-oriented programming tools.

## C and C++ Relationship

C is a subset of C++, which introduced object-oriented features. Learning C provides a foundation for understanding C++,
and any valid C program is also a valid C++ program. Despite the shift towards C++ in the 1990s, C remains a core skill
in demand, consistently ranking among the top 10 desired skills.

## Historical Context

Initially gaining prominence as the development language for the UNIX operating system, C evolved from the earlier
programming language B. While inheriting concepts from B, C introduced data typing and other powerful features,
addressing B's "typeless" nature. By the late 1970s, "traditional C" emerged, leading to standardized versions like
C89/C90, C99, and the current C11.

## C Standards

The current standard, commonly referred to as C11, ensures portability across different platforms with standard C
compilers. While some language elements in C11 are optional, compilers may not implement all features. This guide will
base its examples and concepts on C11, offering a contemporary perspective.

## Enduring Relevance

C's importance endures as one of the most popular programming languages. Despite migrations to languages like C++,
Objective C, and Java, C remains relevant. Its rich history, readability, and writability make it not only a standalone
language but also a stepping stone to others.

In your documentation using Writeside, ensure clarity, coherence, and a balance between historical context and modern
relevance. Consider incorporating practical examples and code snippets to enhance understanding.
