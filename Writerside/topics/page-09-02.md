# Defining a String

In C programming, a string is represented as an array of characters. Unlike some other programming languages, C does not
have a built-in string data type. Instead, strings are typically defined as character arrays with a null
character (`'\0'`) indicating the end of the string. Let's explore how to define strings in C.

## Basic String Declaration

A basic way to define a string in C is to declare a character array and initialize it with a sequence of characters
enclosed in double quotes.

```c
char greeting[] = "Hello, World!";
```

In this example, the size of the array is automatically determined based on the length of the string constant. The null
character is implicitly added at the end.

## Explicit Character Array Declaration

You can also explicitly declare the size of the character array and initialize it with individual characters.

```c
char message[20] = {'W', 'e', 'l', 'c', 'o', 'm', 'e', '\0'};
```

In this case, the size of the array is specified as 20, and the null character is explicitly included to terminate the
string.

## Using `char` Pointer

Another way to define a string is by using a `char` pointer and dynamically allocating memory for the string.

```c
char *name = "John Doe";
```

Here, the string constant is assigned to a `char` pointer. It's important to note that modifying the contents of `name`
may lead to undefined behavior, so it's generally used for read-only strings.

## Manipulating Strings

Once a string is defined, you can use various functions from the `<string.h>` library to manipulate and perform
operations on strings. Common functions include `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strcmp`.

```c
#include <string.h>

char source[] = "Hello";
char destination[20];

// Copying the contents of source to destination
strcpy(destination, source);

// Concatenating " World!" to destination
strcat(destination, " World!");

// Getting the length of the resulting string
int length = strlen(destination);
```

## Conclusion

Defining strings in C involves declaring character arrays and initializing them with sequences of characters.
Understanding the basics of string manipulation and utilizing the appropriate functions is essential for effective
string handling in C.
