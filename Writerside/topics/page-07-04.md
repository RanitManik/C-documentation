# Program: simple Weather Program

## Problem Statement

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a C program that utilizes a two-dimensional array to analyze weather
data. The program should find the total rainfall for each year, the average yearly rainfall, and the average rainfall
for each month. Input will be provided as a 2D array with hard-coded values for rainfall amounts over the past 5 years.
The array should have 5 rows and 12 columns, where each column represents a month, and each row represents a year.
Rainfall amounts can be floating-point numbers.

### Example Output

```text
RAINFALL (inches)
32.4
37.9
49.8
44.0
32.9

The yearly average is 39.4 inches.

MONTHLY AVERAGES:

Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
7.3 7.3 4.9 3.0 2.3 0.6 1.2 0.3 0.5 1.7 3.6 6.7

YEAR
2010
2011
2012
2013
2014
```

Feel free to attempt the challenge. When you're ready for guidance or if you have questions, let me know!

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a 2D array to store rainfall data for 5 years and 12 months.
2. Calculate the total rainfall for each year.
3. Calculate the average yearly rainfall.
4. Calculate the average rainfall for each month.
5. Display the total rainfall for each year.
6. Display the average yearly rainfall.
7. Display the average rainfall for each month.

## Pseudocode

```text
// Initialize a 2D array with hard-coded rainfall data
float rainfallData[5][12] = { { ... }, { ... }, { ... }, { ... }, { ... } };

// Calculate total rainfall for each year
for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
    float totalRainfallYear = 0.0;
    for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        totalRainfallYear += rainfallData[year][month];
    }
    Display totalRainfallYear;
}

// Calculate the average yearly rainfall
float totalRainfallAllYears = 0.0;
for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
    for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        totalRainfallAllYears += rainfallData[year][month];
    }
}
float averageYearlyRainfall = totalRainfallAllYears / 5;
Display averageYearlyRainfall;

// Calculate the average rainfall for each month
float monthlyAverages[12];
for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
    float totalRainfallMonth = 0.0;
    for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
        totalRainfallMonth += rainfallData[year][month];
    }
    monthlyAverages[month] = totalRainfallMonth / 5;
}

// Display the monthly averages
Display monthlyAverages;
```

## Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize a 2D array with hard-coded rainfall data
    float rainfallData[5][12] = {
        {7.3, 5.6, 4.9, 3.0, 2.3, 0.6, 1.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.7, 3.6, 6.7},
        // Add data for the remaining years
        // ...
    };

    // Calculate total rainfall for each year
    printf("RAINFALL (inches)\n");
    for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
        float totalRainfallYear = 0.0;
        for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
            totalRainfallYear += rainfallData[year][month];
        }
        printf("%.1f\n", totalRainfallYear);
    }

    // Calculate the average yearly rainfall
    float totalRainfallAllYears = 0.0;
    for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
        for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
            totalRainfallAllYears += rainfallData[year][month];
        }
    }
    float averageYearlyRainfall = totalRainfallAllYears / 5;
    printf("\nThe yearly average is %.1f inches.\n\n", averageYearlyRainfall);

    // Calculate the average rainfall for each month
    float monthlyAverages[12];
    for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        float totalRainfallMonth = 0.0;
        for (int year = 0; year < 5; year++) {
            totalRainfallMonth += rainfallData[year][month];
        }
        monthlyAverages[month] = totalRainfallMonth / 5;
    }

    // Display the monthly averages
    printf("MONTHLY AVERAGES:\n\n");
    printf("Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec\n");
    for (int month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        printf("%.1f  ", monthlyAverages[month]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

This program initializes a 2D array with rainfall data for five years and twelve months. It then calculates the total
rainfall for each year, the average yearly rainfall, and the average rainfall for each month. The results are displayed
in a formatted manner.
