# Overview

Dynamic memory allocation in C allows for the creation and management of memory at runtime, providing flexibility for
data structures and avoiding the limitations of fixed-size arrays. This section explores the concepts of dynamic memory
allocation, allocation functions, and the importance of proper memory deallocation.

## **Introduction to Dynamic Memory Allocation**

- Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to allocate and deallocate memory at runtime. This is particularly useful
  when the size of data structures is not known at compile time.

    ```c
    int *dynamicArray = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    ```

This example dynamically allocates an array of integers with a size of 5.

## **Malloc and Free Functions**

- The `malloc` function is used to allocate memory, and the `free` function is used to deallocate memory:

    ```c
    int *dynamicArray = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    // Use dynamicArray...
    free(dynamicArray);
    ```

It's crucial to release dynamically allocated memory using `free` to prevent memory leaks.

## **Calloc and Realloc Functions**

- The `calloc` function initializes the allocated memory to zero, and `realloc` can be used to resize dynamically
  allocated memory:

    ```c
    int *zeroedArray = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
    int *resizedArray = (int *)realloc(zeroedArray, 10 * sizeof(int));
    ```

These functions provide additional flexibility in memory allocation and resizing.

## **Dynamic Memory Allocation for Structures**

- Dynamic memory allocation is commonly used with structures to create dynamic structures:

    ```c
    struct Person {
        char *name;
        int age;
    };

    struct Person *personPtr = (struct Person *)malloc(sizeof(struct Person));
    ```

Here, `personPtr` dynamically allocates memory for a `Person` structure.

## **Proper Memory Deallocation**

- Proper memory deallocation is crucial to avoid memory leaks. Always use `free` to release dynamically allocated memory
  when it is no longer needed.

    ```c
    free(dynamicArray);
    ```

Failure to deallocate memory can lead to inefficient memory usage and, in the long run, program instability.

Understanding dynamic memory allocation is essential for building dynamic data structures and managing memory
efficiently in C programming.
