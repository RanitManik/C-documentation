# Program: Finding the Total Number of Lines in a Text File

## Problem Statement

Write a C program to find the total number of lines in a text file. Create a file containing some lines of text, open
the file, use the `fgetc` function to parse characters until the end of the file (EOF), and increment a counter for each
encountered EOF to determine the total number of lines. Display the total number of lines in the file as output.

## Algorithm

1. **Open File:**
    - Open the text file using the `fopen` function.

    ```c
    FILE *filePointer;
    filePointer = fopen("testfile.txt", "r");
    ```

    - Check if the file is successfully opened.

    ```c
    if (filePointer == NULL) {
        // Handle file opening error
    }
    ```

2. **Count Lines:**
    - Initialize a counter to keep track of the lines.

    ```c
    int lineCount = 0;
    ```

    - Use a loop to read characters from the file until the end of the file (EOF).

    ```c
    int character;
    while ((character = fgetc(filePointer)) != EOF) {
        // Check for new line character
        if (character == '\n') {
            // Increment line count
            lineCount++;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Display Output:**
    - Display the total number of lines as output.

    ```c
    printf("Total number of lines: %d\n", lineCount);
    ```

4. **Close File:**
    - Always close the file after operations using the `fclose` function.

    ```c
    fclose(filePointer);
    ```

## Explanation

This program reads characters from a text file using `fgetc` until the end of the file is reached. While parsing, it
checks for newline characters (`'\n'`) and increments a counter for each occurrence. The final count represents the
total number of lines in the file, which is then displayed as output.

This approach provides a simple way to determine the number of lines in a text file without using more advanced file
reading techniques.
