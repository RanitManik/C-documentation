# Nested Loops and Loop Control

In C programming, nested loops and loop control statements (`break` and `continue`) provide additional flexibility for
handling complex scenarios. Let's delve into the syntax and usage of nested loops and loop control statements.

## Nested Loops

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of nested loops
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
            printf("(%d, %d) ", i, j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Program:

1. The outer loop (`for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)`) is responsible for iterating through rows.

2. The inner loop (`for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++)`) iterates through columns for each row.

3. The nested loops together create a grid of values, printing pairs of `(i, j)`.

## Loop Control Statements

### Break Statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of break statement
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        if (i == 3) {
            break; // Exit the loop when i equals 3
        }
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely based on a certain condition. In this example, the loop
terminates when `i` becomes 3.

### Continue Statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of continue statement
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        if (i == 3) {
            continue; // Skip the rest of the loop body when i equals 3
        }
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration. Here, the loop
continues for all values of `i` except when it equals 3.

## Practical Tips

- Nested loops are useful for dealing with matrices, grids, or multi-dimensional data.
- `break` and `continue` statements provide control over loop execution based on specific conditions.

Understanding and effectively utilizing nested loops and loop control statements enhance the versatility of loop
structures in C programming. If you have specific questions or if there are additional topics you'd like to explore,
