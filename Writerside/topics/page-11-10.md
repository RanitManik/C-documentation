# Pointer Arithmetic

Pointer arithmetic in C involves manipulating memory addresses using pointers, providing a powerful mechanism for
navigating through arrays, strings, and data structures. This section explores the principles of pointer arithmetic and
its applications in various scenarios.

## **Basics of Pointer Arithmetic**

- Pointer arithmetic allows you to perform arithmetic operations on pointers. When you add or subtract an integer value
  from a pointer, it moves to the memory location of the corresponding element in the array:

    ```c
    int integerArray[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *pointerToArray = integerArray;

    // Move to the second element
    pointerToArray += 1;  // Now points to the element with value 20
    ```

Here, `pointerToArray` is incremented by 1, pointing to the second element in the array.

## **Increment and Decrement Operations**

- Incrementing and decrementing a pointer adjusts its address based on the size of the data type it points to:

    ```c
    char charArray[3] = {'A', 'B', 'C'};
    char *pointerToChar = charArray;

    // Move to the next character
    pointerToChar++;  // Now points to 'B'
    ```

In this example, `pointerToChar` is incremented by 1, moving to the next character.

## **Pointer Arithmetic with Arrays**

- Pointer arithmetic is often used to traverse arrays:

    ```c
    int integerArray[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int *pointerToArray = integerArray;

    // Access the third element
    int thirdElement = *(pointerToArray + 2);  // Retrieves the value 3
    ```

The expression `*(pointerToArray + 2)` calculates the address of the third element.

## **Pointer Arithmetic and Strings**

- Pointer arithmetic is valuable when working with strings:

    ```c
    char str[] = "Hello";
    char *ptr = str;

    // Access the second character
    char secondChar = *(ptr + 1);  // Retrieves 'e'
    ```

Here, `ptr + 1` calculates the address of the second character in the string.

## **Pointer Arithmetic and Dynamic Allocation**

- Pointer arithmetic is often used with dynamically allocated memory:

    ```c
    int *dynamicArray = (int *)malloc(3 * sizeof(int));

    // Move to the second element
    dynamicArray += 1;
    ```

When dealing with dynamically allocated memory, pointer arithmetic facilitates navigation through allocated blocks.

Mastering pointer arithmetic is essential for efficient memory manipulation and array traversal in C programming.
