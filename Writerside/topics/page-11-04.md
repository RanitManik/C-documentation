# Program: Pointer Demonstration

## Program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Creating a variable
    int originalValue = 42;

    // Creating a pointer and initializing it with the address of the variable
    int *pointerToValue = &originalValue;

    // Accessing the value through the pointer
    printf("Original Value: %d\n", *pointerToValue);

    // Creating a new variable
    int newValue = 99;

    // Assigning the address of the new variable to the pointer
    pointerToValue = &newValue;

    // Accessing the new value through the updated pointer
    printf("New Value: %d\n", *pointerToValue);

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

This program demonstrates the following:

1. **Creation and Initialization of a Pointer:**
    - A variable `originalValue` is created, and a pointer `pointerToValue` is created and initialized with the address
      of `originalValue`.

2. **Accessing Value through the Pointer:**
    - The value of `originalValue` is accessed through the pointer using the dereference operator (`*`).

3. **Creating and Assigning a New Variable:**
    - A new variable `newValue` is created.

4. **Assigning Address of New Variable to the Pointer:**
    - The address of the new variable `newValue` is assigned to the pointer, updating it to point to the new location.

5. **Accessing Value through the Updated Pointer:**
    - The value of the new variable `newValue` is accessed through the updated pointer.

This program provides hands-on experience with creating, initializing, assigning, and accessing pointers. It's a great
way to reinforce the fundamental concepts of working with pointers in C.

Feel free to run the program and experiment with different scenarios. If you have any questions or if there's anything
specific you'd like to explore further, let me know!
