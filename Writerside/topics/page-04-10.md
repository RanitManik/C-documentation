# Program: Calculating the Area of a Triangle

To calculate the area of a triangle, you can use the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Let's create a simple C program that takes the base and height of a triangle as command line arguments and calculates
the area.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Check if both base and height are provided
    if (argc == 3) {
        // Convert command line arguments to floating-point numbers
        float base = atof(argv[1]);
        float height = atof(argv[2]);

        // Check if the provided values are valid
        if (base > 0 && height > 0) {
            // Calculate the area of the triangle
            float area = 0.5 * base * height;

            // Display the result
            printf("Area of the triangle with base %.2f and height %.2f is: %.2f\n", base, height, area);
        } else {
            printf("Both base and height must be positive numbers.\n");
        }
    } else {
        printf("Usage: ./triangle_area <base> <height>\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Running the Program

To run the program, compile it and provide the base and height as command line arguments.

```bash
./triangle_area 5.0 8.0
```

In the above command, `triangle_area` is the name of the compiled executable, and `5.0` and `8.0` are the base and
height values, respectively.

## Conclusion

This C program demonstrates how to calculate the area of a triangle using command line arguments. It checks if the
required inputs are provided, validates the values, performs the calculation, and displays the result. Feel free to
