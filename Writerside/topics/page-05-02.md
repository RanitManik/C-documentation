# Converting Minutes to Years and Days

In this section, we'll create a simple C program to convert a given number of minutes into years and days. The goal is
to provide a practical example of arithmetic operations and how they can be applied to real-world scenarios.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Define constants for conversion
    const int minutesInHour = 60;
    const int hoursInDay = 24;
    const int daysInYear = 365;

    // Input: Number of minutes to be converted
    int totalMinutes;
    printf("Enter the total minutes: ");
    scanf("%d", &totalMinutes);

    // Calculate years and remaining days
    int totalHours = totalMinutes / minutesInHour;
    int totalDays = totalHours / hoursInDay;
    int years = totalDays / daysInYear;
    int remainingDays = totalDays % daysInYear;

    // Display the result
    printf("%d minutes is approximately equal to %d years and %d days.\n", totalMinutes, years, remainingDays);

    return 0;
}
```

## Understanding the Code

1. **Constants:** We define constants for the conversion factors, such as minutes in an hour, hours in a day, and days
   in a year.

2. **User Input:** The user is prompted to enter the total number of minutes they want to convert.

3. **Calculations:** The program performs calculations to convert minutes to years and days. It first converts minutes
   to hours, then hours to days, and finally, days to years and remaining days.

4. **Output:** The result is displayed, indicating the equivalent years and remaining days.

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter the total minutes: 1000000
```

Output:

```bash
1000000 minutes is approximately equal to 1 years and 265 days.
```

## Conclusion

This program demonstrates a practical application of arithmetic operations in C, converting a given number of minutes
into years and days. Understanding how to structure such calculations is valuable for solving various problems in
programming.
