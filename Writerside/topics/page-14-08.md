# Program: Printing the Contents of a File in Reverse Order

## Problem Statement

Write a C program that reads the contents of a file and prints them in reverse order. The program should open the file,
read its contents, and then print the characters or lines in reverse order.

## Algorithm

1. **Open the File for Reading**
    - Use the `fopen` function to open the file in read mode.

    ```c
    FILE *filePointer;
    filePointer = fopen("input.txt", "r");
    ```

    - Check if the file is successfully opened.

    ```c
    if (filePointer == NULL) {
        // Handle file opening error
    }
    ```

2. **Find the Size of the File**
    - Use `fseek` and `ftell` to find the size of the file.

    ```c
    fseek(filePointer, 0, SEEK_END); // Move to the end of the file
    long fileSize = ftell(filePointer); // Get the size of the file
    fseek(filePointer, 0, SEEK_SET); // Move back to the beginning
    ```

3. **Read and Print the Contents in Reverse**
    - Use a loop to read characters or lines in reverse order and print them.

    ```c
    char character;
    for (long i = fileSize - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        fseek(filePointer, i, SEEK_SET);
        character = fgetc(filePointer);
        printf("%c", character);
    }
    ```

    - Alternatively, if the file contains lines, read and print them in reverse order.

    ```c
    char line[100]; // Adjust the size based on the maximum line length
    fseek(filePointer, 0, SEEK_END);
    long currentPosition = ftell(filePointer);

    while (currentPosition > 0) {
        fseek(filePointer, currentPosition - 1, SEEK_SET);
        character = fgetc(filePointer);

        if (character == '\n') {
            // Print the line
            printf("%s\n", line);
            // Reset the line buffer
            memset(line, 0, sizeof(line));
        } else {
            // Concatenate the character to the line buffer
            strncat(line, &character, 1);
        }

        currentPosition--;
    }
    ```

4. **Close the File**
    - Close the file after reading and printing.

    ```c
    fclose(filePointer);
    ```

## Explanation

This program reads the contents of a file and prints them in reverse order. The size of the file is determined, and then
characters or lines are read in reverse order using `fseek` and `fgetc`. Finally, the file is closed.

Ensure that the input file exists and has the necessary permissions for reading. This program provides a simple way to
print the contents of a file in reverse order.
