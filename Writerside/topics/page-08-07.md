# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is a powerful programming concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. In C programming,
recursion provides an elegant and concise solution to certain types of problems. This document aims to explore the
fundamentals of recursion in C, providing examples and guidelines for effective implementation.

## Basics of Recursion

Recursion involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem, and combining the results
to obtain the final solution. The key components of a recursive function are:

1. **Base Case:** A condition that indicates when the recursion should stop. It prevents the function from calling
   itself indefinitely.

2. **Recursive Case:** The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified set of parameters. This step
   contributes to breaking down the problem.

## Example: Factorial Calculation

Let's explore a simple example to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Recursive function to calculate factorial
int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        // Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int num = 5;
    printf("Factorial of %d is %d\n", num, factorial(num));

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calls itself with a smaller value (`n - 1`) until it reaches the base
case (`n == 0` or `n == 1`), providing a clear illustration of recursion.

## Tips for Using Recursion

1. **Define Base Cases:** Ensure that your recursive function has well-defined base cases to prevent infinite recursion.

2. **Optimize for Efficiency:** Recursive solutions may not always be the most efficient. Consider alternatives like
   iteration for performance-critical scenarios.

3. **Memory Usage:** Recursive calls consume stack space. Be cautious with deep recursion to avoid stack overflow
   errors.

4. **Test Thoroughly:** Test your recursive functions with various inputs to ensure they provide correct results and
   handle edge cases gracefully.

## Conclusion

Recursion in C offers an elegant way to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Understanding the
base cases and recursive cases is crucial for effective implementation. With careful consideration, recursion can be a
valuable tool in a C programmer's arsenal.
