# Displaying Output

Displaying output is a fundamental aspect of C programming, allowing you to communicate information to users through the console. In this section, we'll explore various techniques and functions used to display output in C, focusing on the commonly used `printf()` function.

## The `printf()` Function

The `printf()` function is the primary tool for output in C. It allows you to format and display text, variables, and other data on the console. Here's a basic example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the string "Hello, World!\n" is printed to the console, where `\n` represents a newline character.

## Formatting Output

`printf()` supports various format specifiers that control the display of different types of data. Here are some common ones:

- `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Float
- `%c`: Character
- `%s`: String

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 25;
    float height = 5.8;
    char grade = 'A';
    char name[] = "John";

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f feet\n", height);
    printf("Grade: %c\n", grade);
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);

    return 0;
}
```

## Escape Sequences

Escape sequences are special characters that represent non-printable characters or provide specific formatting. Common escape sequences include `\n` for a newline, `\t` for a tab, and `\"` for a double quote.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("This is a new line.\n");
    printf("This text is\ttabbed.\n");
    printf("He said, \"Hello!\"\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Field Width and Precision

You can control the field width and precision of the displayed values using numeric parameters in the format specifier. For example, `%5d` specifies a field width of 5 for an integer.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1 = 123;
    float num2 = 12.3456;

    printf("Number 1: %5d\n", num1);
    printf("Number 2: %.2f\n", num2);

    return 0;
}
```

## Concatenating Strings

You can concatenate strings using the `%s` specifier. Additionally, you can use multiple specifiers in a single `printf()` statement.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char first_name[] = "John";
    char last_name[] = "Doe";

    printf("Full Name: %s %s\n", first_name, last_name);

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Displaying output in C is achieved through the versatile `printf()` function. By understanding format specifiers, escape sequences, and additional options, you can present information effectively to users. This is a fundamental skill that lays the groundwork for creating interactive and informative C programs.
