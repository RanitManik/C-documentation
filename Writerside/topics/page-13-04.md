# Structures and Pointers

Combining structures with pointers in C allows for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of structured data. Let's
explore how structures and pointers can be used together:

## **Pointer to Structure**

- You can declare a pointer to a structure in a similar way to declaring a pointer to other data types.

    ```c
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };

    struct Point *pointPtr;
    ```

## **Dynamic Memory Allocation for Structures**

- Allocate memory for a structure dynamically using the `malloc` function.

    ```c
    struct Point *dynamicPoint = (struct Point *)malloc(sizeof(struct Point));
    ```

Ensure to check if the memory allocation was successful before proceeding.

## **Accessing Members via Pointers**

- Use the arrow (`->`) operator to access members of a structure through a pointer.

    ```c
    dynamicPoint->x = 10;
    dynamicPoint->y = 20;
    ```

## **Passing Structures to Functions via Pointers**

- Pass structures to functions using pointers for more efficient memory handling.

    ```c
    void initializePoint(struct Point *ptr, int xVal, int yVal) {
        ptr->x = xVal;
        ptr->y = yVal;
    }
    ```

Call the function: `initializePoint(dynamicPoint, 30, 40);`.

## **Array of Pointers to Structures**

- Create an array of pointers to structures for managing multiple structured entities.

    ```c
    struct Point *pointsArray[5];
    ```

## **Deallocating Memory**

- Properly deallocate dynamically allocated memory using the `free` function.

    ```c
    free(dynamicPoint);
    ```

Always free memory when it's no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.

Structures and pointers together enable dynamic handling of structured data, offering flexibility and efficiency in
memory management. Whether allocating memory for structures dynamically or passing structures to functions via pointers,
this combination is crucial for working with complex data structures.
