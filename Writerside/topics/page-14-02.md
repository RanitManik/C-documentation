# Accessing Files

Accessing files in C involves a series of operations to open, read, write, and close files. This page provides a
detailed overview of how to perform these actions.

## 1. **Opening Files**

- To open a file, use the `fopen` function. It requires the file path and the mode in which the file is opened (read,
  write, etc.).

    ```c
    FILE *filePointer;
    filePointer = fopen("example.txt", "r");
    ```

- Common file modes include:
    - `"r"`: Read
    - `"w"`: Write (creates or truncates file)
    - `"a"`: Append (creates or appends to file)
    - `"r+"`: Read and Write
    - `"w+"`: Read and Write (creates or truncates file)

## 2. **Reading from Files**

- Use functions like `fscanf` or `fgets` to read data from a file.

    ```c
    char buffer[100];
    fscanf(filePointer, "%s", buffer);
    ```

- Ensure proper error checking to handle situations where the file does not exist or cannot be opened.

    ```c
    if (filePointer == NULL) {
        // Handle error
    }
    ```

## 3. **Writing to Files**

- Use functions like `fprintf` or `fputs` to write data to a file.

    ```c
    fprintf(filePointer, "Hello, World!\n");
    ```

- Check for successful file opening before performing write operations.

## 4. **Closing Files**

- Always close a file after operations using the `fclose` function. This ensures that resources are released.

    ```c
    fclose(filePointer);
    ```

## 5. **Binary Files**

- File I/O can be performed in binary mode (`"rb"`, `"wb"`, etc.) for non-text files.

    ```c
    filePointer = fopen("binaryfile.bin", "rb");
    ```

## 6. **Handling File Errors**

- Check the return value of file functions to handle errors effectively.

    ```c
    if (fscanf(filePointer, "%s", buffer) == EOF) {
        // Handle end-of-file or read error
    }
    ```

## 7. **Seeking in Files**

- Use functions like `fseek` to move the file pointer to a specific position in the file.

    ```c
    fseek(filePointer, 0, SEEK_SET); // Move to the beginning of the file
    ```

Accessing files in C is a crucial skill for handling data persistently. Whether reading or writing, proper error
handling and resource management ensure robust file operations.
