# Data Types and Variables

In C programming, data types and variables are fundamental concepts that form the building blocks of your programs.
Understanding how to declare and use different data types allows you to store and manipulate information effectively. In
this section, we'll explore the common data types in C and how to declare variables.

## Basic Data Types in C

### 1. **int (Integer)**

Used to store integer values.

```c
int age = 25;
```

### 2. **float**

Used to store floating-point numbers (real numbers).

```c
float salary = 50000.75;
```

### 3. **double**

Similar to `float` but with higher precision.

```c
double pi = 3.1415926535;
```

### 4. **char (Character)**

Used to store a single character.

```c
char grade = 'A';
```

### 5. **_Bool (Boolean)**

Used to store true or false values (0 or 1).

```c
_Bool isStudent = 1;  // true
```

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable, specify its data type followed by the variable name. You can also initialize the variable at the
time of declaration.

```c
int count;           // Declaration
float temperature = 98.6;  // Declaration and initialization
```

## Constants

Constants are values that do not change during the execution of a program. In C, you can use the `const` keyword to
define constants.

```c
const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
```

## Modifiers

Modifiers such as `short`, `long`, `signed`, and `unsigned` can be used with basic data types to modify their range or
behavior.

```c
short smallNumber = 10;
unsigned long bigPositiveNumber = 4294967295;
```

## Sizeof Operator

The `sizeof` operator returns the size, in bytes, of a data type or a variable.

```c
int size = sizeof(int);
```

## Type Casting

Type casting allows you to convert a value from one data type to another.

```c
float average;
int sum = 105;
int count = 5;

average = (float)sum / count;
```

## size of common data types

Here's a table showing the size of common data types in C programming, along with their typical ranges:

| Data Type          | Size (in bytes) | Typical Range                            |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| int                | 4               | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647          |
| float              | 4               | 1.2E-38 to 3.4E38 (6 decimal places)     |
| double             | 8               | 2.3E-308 to 1.7E308 (15 decimal places)  |
| char               | 1               | -128 to 127 or 0 to 255                  |
| _Bool              | 1               | 0 to 1                                   |
| short              | 2               | -32,768 to 32,767                        |
| long               | 4 or 8          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (32-bit) |
| long long          | 8               | -(2^63) to (2^63)-1                      |
| unsigned           | varies          | 0 to 4,294,967,295 (32-bit)              |
| unsigned long      | varies          | 0 to 4,294,967,295 (32-bit) or (64-bit)  |
| unsigned long long | varies          | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (64-bit) |

Note: The actual size of data types may vary depending on the compiler and the system architecture. The sizes mentioned
above are typical for a 32-bit or 64-bit system.

## Conclusion

Data types and variables are essential components of C programming, enabling you to work with different types of
information. By choosing the appropriate data type for your variables, you optimize memory usage and ensure accurate
representation of values. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial as you progress in writing more complex
and efficient C programs.
