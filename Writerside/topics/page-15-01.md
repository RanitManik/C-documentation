# Overview

Standard header files in C provide essential functionalities and declarations for commonly used functions and constants.
Including these header files in your programs allows you to utilize various features without having to redefine them.
Here's an overview of some commonly used standard header files:

## **`#include <stdio.h>` (Standard Input/Output)**

- This header file is crucial for input and output operations.
- Declarations for functions like `printf`, `scanf`, `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    ```

## **`#include <stdlib.h>` (Standard Library)**

- This header file includes functions involving memory allocation, random number generation, and other general-purpose
  functions.
- Declarations for functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, `free`, `rand`, `exit`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    ```

## **`#include <string.h>` (String Manipulation)**

- Useful for string-related operations, such as copying, concatenation, and comparison.
- Declarations for functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strlen`, `strcmp`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <string.h>
    ```

## **`#include <math.h>` (Mathematics)**

- This header file provides mathematical functions for operations like square root, logarithm, trigonometry, etc.
- Declarations for functions like `sqrt`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <math.h>
    ```

## **`#include <ctype.h>` (Character Classification)**

- Useful for character-related operations, such as checking if a character is alphanumeric or converting characters to
  uppercase or lowercase.
- Declarations for functions like `isalpha`, `isdigit`, `toupper`, `tolower`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <ctype.h>
    ```

## **`#include <time.h>` (Time and Date)**

- This header file provides functions for working with time and date.
- Declarations for functions like `time`, `ctime`, `gmtime`, `strftime`, etc., are included.

    ```c
    #include <time.h>
    ```

Including these standard header files in your C programs enhances their functionality by providing access to a wide
range of functions and constants. Understanding when and how to use these header files is essential for efficient C
programming.
