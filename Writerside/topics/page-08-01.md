# Overview of Functions

## Introduction

Functions are an essential concept in C programming, allowing you to break down a program into smaller, manageable
pieces of code. A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. Understanding the basics of
functions is crucial for writing modular and readable C code.

## Function Declaration

The syntax for declaring a function in C is as follows:

```c
returnType functionName(parameters) {
    // Function body
}
```

- `returnType`: Specifies the type of data the function will return (e.g., `int`, `void`).
- `functionName`: The name of the function.
- `parameters`: Input values that the function accepts (optional).

## Example Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    // Function call
    int result = add(3, 5);

    // Display the result
    printf("Sum: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In this example, the function `add` takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) and returns their sum.

## Function Call

To use a function, you need to call it within the program. The syntax for calling a function is:

```c
returnType result = functionName(arguments);
```

## Return Statement

The `return` statement is used to send the result back to the calling code. It also terminates the execution of the
function.

```c
return expression;
```

## Function Prototypes

Function prototypes provide a declaration of the function before its actual definition. They are usually placed at the
beginning of the program or in a header file.

```c
returnType functionName(parameters);
```

## Function Parameters

Parameters are the input values that a function accepts. They are declared in the function declaration and used in the
function body.

```c
int multiply(int x, int y) {
    return x * y;
}
```

## Void Functions

A function with a `void` return type does not return any value. It is typically used for tasks that don't produce a
result.

```c
void greet() {
    printf("Hello!\n");
}
```

## Scope of Variables

Variables declared within a function have local scope, meaning they are accessible only within that function.

```c
int globalVariable = 10; // Global variable

void exampleFunction() {
    int localVariable = 5; // Local variable
    printf("Global Variable: %d\n", globalVariable);
    printf("Local Variable: %d\n", localVariable);
}
```

Understanding the basics of functions is a foundational step in becoming proficient in C programming. As you gain more
experience, you'll discover advanced concepts like function pointers, recursion, and variadic functions. If you have
