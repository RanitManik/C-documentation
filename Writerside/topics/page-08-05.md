# Variable Scoping

## Introduction

In C programming, variables play a crucial role in storing and manipulating data. Understanding the concepts of local
and global variables is essential for writing well-structured and modular code. Let's delve into the definitions,
characteristics, and use cases of local and global variables.

## Local Variables

**Definition**

- **Local variables** are declared within a specific block or function.
- They are accessible only within the block or function where they are declared.
- Local variables are created when the block or function is entered and destroyed when it is exited.

**Characteristics**

1. **Scope:**
    - Limited to the block or function where they are declared.
    - Not visible outside the block or function.

2. **Lifetime:**
    - Created when the block or function is entered.
    - Destroyed when the block or function is exited.

3. **Initialization:**
    - Not automatically initialized.
    - Need explicit initialization before use.

4. **Access:**
    - Accessible only within the block or function.

**Example**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void exampleFunction() {
    int localVar = 10; // Local variable

    // Accessing and modifying the local variable
    printf("Local Variable: %d\n", localVar);
    localVar++;
    printf("Modified Local Variable: %d\n", localVar);
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction();
    // Uncommenting the next line will result in an error
    // printf("Attempt to Access Local Variable: %d\n", localVar);

    return 0;
}
```

## Global Variables

**Definition**

- **Global variables** are declared outside of any function or block.
- They are accessible throughout the entire program.
- Global variables are created when the program starts and destroyed when it ends.

### Characteristics

1. **Scope:**
    - Accessible throughout the entire program.

2. **Lifetime:**
    - Created when the program starts.
    - Destroyed when the program ends.

3. **Initialization:**
    - Automatically initialized if not explicitly initialized.

4. **Access:**
    - Accessible from any part of the program.

**Example**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Global variable
int globalVar = 20;

void exampleFunction() {
    // Accessing and modifying the global variable
    printf("Global Variable: %d\n", globalVar);
    globalVar++;
    printf("Modified Global Variable: %d\n", globalVar);
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction();

    // Accessing the global variable from main
    printf("Global Variable from main: %d\n", globalVar);

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion

Local and global variables serve distinct purposes in C programming. Local variables are useful for encapsulating data
within specific functions or blocks, while global variables provide a way to share data across different parts of the
program. Proper understanding and usage of these variables contribute to writing efficient and maintainable code.
