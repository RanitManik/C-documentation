# Introduction to Arrays

Arrays are crucial data structures in C that enable the storage and manipulation of collections of elements of the same
data type. This comprehensive guide will cover the fundamentals of creating, initializing, accessing, and working with
arrays in C.

## What is an Array?

An array is a systematic arrangement of elements, all of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Each
element in the array is identified by an index or a subscript.

## Declaring an Array

To declare an array in C, you need to specify the data type of its elements, followed by the array name and the size of
the array in square brackets.

```c
// Syntax: dataType arrayName[arraySize];
int numbers[5]; // Example: declaring an integer array of size 5
```

This declaration indicates that `numbers` is an array capable of holding five integers.

## Initializing an Array

Arrays can be initialized during declaration or at a later stage in the program.

### Initializing during Declaration

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

Here, an integer array named `numbers` is declared and initialized with values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

### Initializing Later

```c
int temperatures[7];
temperatures[0] = 22;
temperatures[1] = 24;
// ... continue initializing other elements
```

In this example, an integer array named `temperatures` is declared first, and its elements are initialized later in the
program.

## Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using their indices. The index starts at 0 and goes up to (array size - 1).

```c
int firstNumber = numbers[0]; // Accessing the first element
int secondNumber = numbers[1]; // Accessing the second element
```

In C, the syntax for accessing an array element is `arrayName[index]`. The index represents the position of the element
in the array.

## Example Program

Let's create a comprehensive example program that declares, initializes, and prints the elements of an integer array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize an integer array
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Print the elements of the array
    printf("Elements of the array: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("%d ", numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```
Elements of the array: 1 2 3 4 5
```

This program demonstrates the complete process of declaring, initializing, and accessing elements in an integer array.

## Practical Tips

1. **Array Size:**
    - The array size must be a constant expression or a constant variable.
    - Arrays cannot be resized once declared.

2. **Zero-Based Indexing:**
    - Remember that array indices start from 0.

3. **Traversal:**
    - Use loops for efficient traversal of array elements.

4. **Initialization:**
    - Initialize arrays during declaration for concise code.

5. **Bounds Checking:**
    - Exercise caution to avoid accessing elements beyond the array bounds.
