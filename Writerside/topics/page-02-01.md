# Setting Up VSCode for Windows

## Step 1: Download and Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

1. Visit the official [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Download the installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer (`.exe` file) and follow the on-screen instructions to install VSCode.

## Step 2: Install C/C++ Extension

1. Open VSCode after installation.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or using
   the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. In the Extensions view search box, type "C/C++".
4. Install the extension provided by Microsoft.

## Step 3: Install a C Compiler (MinGW)

1. Download and install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows):
    - Visit the [MinGW download page](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php).
    - Click on "Downloads" in the left sidebar.
    - Download the installer for your architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
    - Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

## Step 4: Add MinGW to System Path

1. After MinGW installation, locate the installation directory (e.g., `C:\MinGW`).
2. Add the MinGW `bin` directory to the system Path:
    - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on your desktop or in File Explorer.
    - Select "Properties" > "Advanced system settings."
    - Click on "Environment Variables."
    - In the "System variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
    - Click "New" and add the path to the MinGW `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\MinGW\bin`).
    - Click "OK" to close the windows.

## Step 5: Create a C File and Compile

1. Open VSCode.
2. Click on "File" > "New File" to create a new file.
3. Save the file with a `.c` extension, for example, `hello.c`.
4. Write your C code in the editor.
5. Open the terminal in VSCode.
6. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ```
7. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   hello
   ```

## Step 6: Explore Other IDEs (Optional)

While VSCode is a great choice, you can explore alternative IDEs for C programming on Windows:

- **Dev-C++:** [Download Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/)
- **Code::Blocks:** [Download Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/)

Choose an IDE that best suits your preferences.

## Conclusion

This guide has helped you set up Visual Studio Code for C programming on Windows. Whether you continue with VSCode or
explore other IDEs, make sure to choose the one that enhances your coding experience. Happy coding!
