# Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators in C allow for intricate manipulation of individual bits within integer variables. These operators are
fundamental in scenarios requiring efficient binary data manipulation, such as data compression, cryptography, and
low-level hardware interaction. Let's delve deeper into each bitwise operator, providing detailed explanations and
practical examples.

## 1. **Bitwise AND (`&`)**

Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. It is often used for masking specific bits while
preserving others.

**Example Application:**
Setting certain bits to 0 while keeping others unchanged in a variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int original = 14;  // Binary: 1110

    // Applying a mask to keep only the first and third bits
    int result = original & 5;  // Binary: 0101

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after AND operation: %d\n", result);  
    // Result is 4 (binary: 0100)

    return 0;
}
```

## 2. **Bitwise OR (`|`)**

Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. Useful for combining specific bits.

**Example Application:**
Setting certain bits to 1 while keeping others unchanged in a variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int original = 6;  // Binary: 0110

    // Applying a mask to set the second and fourth bits to 1
    int result = original | 10;  // Binary: 1010

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after OR operation: %d\n", result);  
    // Result is 14 (binary: 1110)

    return 0;
}
```

## 3. **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**

Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. Useful for toggling specific bits.

**Example Application:**
Toggling the state of certain bits in a variable.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int flags = 9;  // Binary: 1001

    // Toggling the second and fourth bits
    flags = flags ^ 10;  // Binary: 1010

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after XOR operation: %d\n", flags);  
    // Result is 3 (binary: 0011)

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**

Inverts the bits of its operand, turning 0s to 1s and vice versa.

**Example Application:**
Creating a bitmask to represent excluded bits.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int original = 6;  // Binary: 0110

    // Creating a bitmask by inverting the bits
    int bitmask = ~original;  // Binary: 1001

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after NOT operation: %d\n", bitmask);  
    // Result is -7 (binary: 1111)

    return 0;
}
```

## 5. **Left Shift (`<<`)**

Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by a specified number of positions.

**Example Application:**
Performing a multiplication by powers of 2.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int original = 3;  // Binary: 0011

    // Left shifting by 2 positions (multiplying by 4)
    int result = original << 2;  // Binary: 1100

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after left shift: %d\n", result);  
    // Result is 12 (binary: 1100)

    return 0;
}
```

## 6. **Right Shift (`>>`)**

Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by a specified number of positions.

**Example Application:**
Performing a division by powers of 2.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int original = 16;  // Binary: 10000

    // Right shifting by 2 positions (dividing by 4)
    int result = original >> 2;  // Binary: 0010

    // Display the result
    printf("Result after right shift: %d\n", result);  
    // Result is 4 (binary: 0010)

    return 0;
}
```

## Practical Scenario: Flag Management

Consider a scenario where bitwise operators are employed for managing flags in a system.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define flags
#define READ_FLAG 1
#define WRITE_FLAG 2
#define EXECUTE_FLAG 4

int main() {
    // Combining read and write flags
    int permissions = READ_FLAG | WRITE_FLAG;  

    // Checking if execute flag is set
    if ((permissions & EXECUTE_FLAG) != 0) {
        printf("Execute permission granted.\n");
    } else {
        printf("Execute permission not granted.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, bitwise OR is used to combine flags, and bitwise AND is used to check if a specific flag is set.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages:**

- Efficient for low-level bit manipulation tasks.
- Useful for optimizing memory usage in certain scenarios.
- Enables compact representation of multiple binary flags within a single variable.

**Disadvantages:**

- May make code less readable, especially when used excessively.
- Requires careful handling to avoid undefined behavior, especially with shifting operations.
- Limited use in high-level programming where abstraction is preferred over direct bit manipulation.

operators can greatly enhance the efficiency and flexibility of your code, especially in scenarios involving low-level
