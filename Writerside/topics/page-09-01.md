# Character Strings Overview

## Introduction

In C programming, character strings are sequences of characters stored in contiguous memory locations. Unlike some
high-level languages, C does not have a built-in string type; instead, strings are represented as arrays of characters.
Let's explore the fundamental concepts related to character strings in C.

## Declaration of Character Strings

Character strings in C are typically declared as arrays of characters. The array size should be large enough to
accommodate the string characters along with the null character (`'\0'`), which marks the end of the string.

```c
char greeting[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
// or
char greeting[] = "Hello";
```

The second declaration automatically calculates the size based on the number of characters in the string plus one for
the null character.

## String Initialization

Strings can be initialized at the time of declaration or later using various methods.

```c
char message[] = "Welcome";
// or
char message[8];
strcpy(message, "Welcome");
```

Here, `strcpy` is a string copy function from the `<string.h>` library.

## String Input and Output

C provides functions for reading and displaying strings:

```c
char name[20];
printf("Enter your name: ");
scanf("%19s", name); // Read a string (limiting to 19 characters to leave space for null character)
printf("Hello, %s!\n", name); // Display the string
```

## String Functions

C provides a set of standard library functions for string manipulation. Some commonly used functions include:

- `strlen`: Calculates the length of a string.
- `strcpy`: Copies one string to another.
- `strcat`: Concatenates two strings.
- `strcmp`: Compares two strings.

```c
#include <string.h>

char str1[20] = "Hello";
char str2[] = "World";

int length = strlen(str1);
strcpy(str1, "Bonjour");
strcat(str1, " ");
strcat(str1, str2);
int comparison = strcmp(str1, str2);
```

## Character Array vs. String

In C, a character array and a string are often used interchangeably. However, it's essential to remember that a
character array becomes a string when null-terminated.

```c
char arr[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}; // Not a string
char str[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'}; // String
```

## Conclusion

Character strings play a crucial role in C programming for representing and manipulating text data. Understanding the
array-based representation and utilizing string functions contribute to effective string handling in C.
