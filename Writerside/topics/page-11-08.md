# Array Pointers

Array pointers in C provide a flexible mechanism for manipulating arrays efficiently using pointers. This section
explores the relationship between arrays and pointers, focusing on using pointers to navigate and manipulate array
elements.

## 1. **Pointer Declaration for Arrays:**

- Pointers can be used to point to the beginning of an array:

    ```c
    int integerArray[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *pointerToArray = integerArray;
    ```

This establishes `pointerToArray` as a pointer pointing to the first element of `integerArray`.

## 2. **Accessing Array Elements with Pointers:**

- Array elements can be accessed using pointers and pointer arithmetic:

    ```c
    int thirdElement = *(pointerToArray + 2);
    ```

Here, `pointerToArray + 2` calculates the address of the third element, and `*(pointerToArray + 2)` retrieves its value.

## 3. **Iterating Through Arrays with Pointers:**

- Pointers facilitate array traversal using loops:

    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        printf("%d ", *(pointerToArray + i));
    }
    ```

This loop prints each element of `integerArray` by utilizing pointer arithmetic.

## 4. **Pointer Arithmetic and Array Names:**

- Array names, when used in expressions, behave like pointers to their first elements:

    ```c
    int firstElement = *integerArray;
    ```

This assigns the value of the first element of `integerArray` to `firstElement`.

## 5. **Passing Arrays to Functions using Pointers:**

- Arrays can be passed to functions using pointers:

    ```c
    void printArray(int *arr, int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            printf("%d ", *(arr + i));
        }
    }
    ```

This function prints the elements of an array by accepting a pointer to its first element.

Understanding array pointers is fundamental for efficient array manipulation, especially when dealing with larger
datasets.
