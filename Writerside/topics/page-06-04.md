# Switch Statement

The `switch` statement in C provides a way to make multi-way decisions based on the value of an expression. It allows
the program to choose a specific code block to execute from several alternatives. Let's explore the syntax and usage of
the `switch` statement.

## Basic Syntax of Switch Statement

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;

    // Prompt the user to enter a choice
    printf("Enter a choice (1, 2, or 3): ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    // Switch statement
    switch (choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("You chose Option 1\n");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("You chose Option 2\n");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("You chose Option 3\n");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid choice\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Program:

1. We declare a variable `choice` to store the user's input.

2. The `printf` function prompts the user to enter a choice, and `scanf` reads the input into the `choice` variable.

3. The `switch` statement is used to check the value of `choice` against different cases.

4. Each `case` represents a possible value of `choice`. If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed.

5. The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement after a case is executed.

6. The `default` case is optional and executed if none of the `case` values matches the value of `choice`.

## Handling Fall-Through

Unlike some other programming languages, C allows fall-through behavior between cases. If there is no `break` statement,
the control will fall through to the next case.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int day = 3;

    // Switch statement with fall-through
    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            printf("Monday\n");
        case 2:
            printf("Tuesday\n");
        case 3:
            printf("Wednesday\n");
        default:
            printf("Unknown day\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, if `day` is 3, the output will be:

```
Wednesday
Unknown day
```

## Practical Tips

- Each `case` in a `switch` statement should end with a `break` statement to avoid fall-through behavior unless
  intentional.
- Use the `default` case to handle unexpected or invalid values.

Understanding and effectively using the `switch` statement enhances the flexibility of decision-making in C programs. If
