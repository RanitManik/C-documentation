# Program: Writing a C Program to Display Your Name

In this section, we'll guide you through the process of writing a simple C program that displays your name. This exercise will help reinforce the basics of C programming and introduce you to the `printf()` function for output.

## The Structure of the Program

Before diving into the code, let's recall the basic structure of a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Your code goes here
    return 0;
}
```

This structure includes the necessary header file (`<stdio.h>`) and the main function (`main()`), where the execution of your program begins.

## Writing the Name Display Program

Now, let's create a program that prints your name to the console. Here's a simple example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Displaying your name
    printf("My name is [Your Name]\n");

    return 0;
}
```

Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name. The `printf()` function is used to print text to the console, and `\n` represents a newline character, which adds a line break after displaying your name.

## Getting Started

1. **Open a Text Editor:**
    - Choose a text editor of your preference (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text) to write your C code.

2. **Create a New File:**
    - Create a new file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `display_name.c`) to save your C code.

3. **Write Your Code:**
    - Copy and paste the provided C code into your file.

4. **Save the File:**
    - Save your file.

## Compiling and Running Your Program

As mentioned in the previous sections, use the following steps to compile and run your program:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    - Navigate to the directory containing your C file using the `cd` command.

2. **Compile the Code:**
    - Use the following command to compile your code:
      ```bash
      gcc display_name.c -o display_name
      ```

3. **Execute the Program:**
    - On Linux:
      ```bash
      ./display_name
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      display_name.exe
      ```

4. **View the Output:**
    - The console should display your name as per the `printf()` statement in your code.

## Exploring Variations

Feel free to experiment with variations of the program. You can add additional information, change the formatting, or even prompt the user to enter their name using `scanf()` for interactive input.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char name[50];

    // Prompt user for name input
    printf("Enter your name: ");
    scanf("%s", name);

    // Displaying the entered name
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);

    return 0;
}
```

This variation prompts the user to enter their name, which is then displayed with a greeting.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully written a C program that displays your name. This simple exercise provides hands-on experience with basic input and output operations in C. As you progress in your C programming journey, you'll build on these fundamentals to create more complex and feature-rich applications.
