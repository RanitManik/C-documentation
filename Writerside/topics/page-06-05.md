# For Loop

The `for` loop in C provides a concise way to repeatedly execute a block of code. It is particularly useful when the
number of iterations is known in advance. Let's explore the syntax and usage of the `for` loop.

## Basic Syntax of For Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of a for loop
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Program:

1. The `for` loop is initialized with three parts:
    - Initialization (`int i = 1`): It is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
    - Condition (`i <= 5`): The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
    - Update (`i++`): Executed after each iteration.

2. The body of the loop contains the code to be executed in each iteration.

3. In this example, the loop prints "Iteration 1" to "Iteration 5" since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each
   iteration.

## Looping Through Arrays

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Example of a for loop iterating through an array
    int numbers[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, numbers[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Here, the `for` loop is used to iterate through an array (`numbers`) and print each element along with its index.

## Practical Tips

- The loop variable (`i` in the examples) is typically used to control the number of iterations.
- Ensure that the loop condition has a clear termination point to avoid infinite loops.
- The loop variable can be used for various purposes within the loop body.

Understanding and utilizing the `for` loop is essential for efficient and concise iteration in C programming. If you
