# Program: Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction

In this section, we'll create a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game in C. Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game
where the goal is to form a line of three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on
a 3x3 grid.

## Algorithm

1. **Initialize Board:**
    - Create a 3x3 matrix representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
    - Initialize all cells with empty spaces.

2. **Display Board:**
    - Display the current state of the board to the players.

3. **Get Player Move:**
    - Ask the current player to input their move (row and column).

4. **Validate Move:**
    - Check if the specified move is within the board boundaries.
    - Verify that the selected cell is empty.

5. **Update Board:**
    - If the move is valid, update the board with the current player's symbol.

6. **Check for Win:**
    - Check if the current player has won horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    - If a win is detected, declare the current player as the winner.

7. **Check for Tie:**
    - Check if the board is full (all cells are filled) without a winner.
    - If a tie is detected, declare the game as a tie.

8. **Switch Player:**
    - Switch to the other player (from 'X' to 'O' or vice versa).

9. **Repeat:**
    - Repeat steps 2-8 until a win or a tie is achieved.

## Pseudocode

```text
function initializeBoard():
    for each row in board:
        for each cell in row:
            cell = ' '

function displayBoard():
    print("  0 1 2")
    for i from 0 to 2:
        print(i, end=" ")
        for j from 0 to 2:
            print(board[i][j], end=" ")
        print()

function isMoveValid(row, col):
    return (0 <= row < 3) and (0 <= col < 3) and (board[row][col] == ' ')

function checkForWin(player):
    for i from 0 to 2:
        if (board[i][0] == player and board[i][1] == player and board[i][2] == player) or
           (board[0][i] == player and board[1][i] == player and board[2][i] == player):
            return true

    if (board[0][0] == player and board[1][1] == player and board[2][2] == player) or
       (board[0][2] == player and board[1][1] == player and board[2][0] == player):
        return true

    return false

function isBoardFull():
    for each row in board:
        for each cell in row:
            if cell is empty:
                return false
    return true

function main():
    initializeBoard()
    currentPlayer = 'X'

    repeat:
        displayBoard()

        print("Player", currentPlayer + ",", "enter your move (row and column): ")
        row, col = getUserInput()

        if isMoveValid(row, col):
            board[row][col] = currentPlayer

            if checkForWin(currentPlayer):
                displayBoard()
                print("Player", currentPlayer, "wins!")
                break

            if isBoardFull():
                displayBoard()
                print("The game is a tie!")
                break

            currentPlayer = switchPlayer(currentPlayer)
        else:
            print("Invalid move. Try again.")

    end repeat
```

This pseudocode outlines the key steps of the Tic Tac Toe game, providing a structured guide for the implementation in
C. Feel free to use this as a reference when coding the actual program.

## Program Structure

### 1. **Header Files**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

### 2. **Constants**

```c
#define SIZE 3
```

Define constants for the board size.

### 3. **Function Declarations**

```c
void initializeBoard(char board[SIZE][SIZE]);
void displayBoard(char board[SIZE][SIZE]);
int isMoveValid(int row, int col, char board[SIZE][SIZE]);
int isBoardFull(char board[SIZE][SIZE]);
int checkForWin(char board[SIZE][SIZE], char player);
```

### 4. **Main Function**

```c
int main() {
    char board[SIZE][SIZE];
    char currentPlayer = 'X';
    int row, col;

    initializeBoard(board);

    do {
        displayBoard(board);

        printf("Player %c, enter your move (row and column): ", currentPlayer);
        scanf("%d %d", &row, &col);

        if (isMoveValid(row, col, board)) {
            board[row][col] = currentPlayer;

            if (checkForWin(board, currentPlayer)) {
                displayBoard(board);
                printf("Player %c wins!\n", currentPlayer);
                break;

                printf("The game is a tie!\n");
                break;
            }

            currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 'X') ? 'O' : 'X';
        } else {
            printf("Invalid move. Try again.\n");
