# While and Do-While Loops

In addition to the `for` loop, C provides the `while` and `do-while` loops for iterating through code blocks based on
certain conditions. Let's explore the syntax and usage of both the `while` and `do-while` loops.

## 1. While Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int count = 1;

    // Example of a while loop
    while (count <= 5) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", count);
        count++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Program:

1. The `while` loop continues to execute the code block as long as the specified condition (`count <= 5`) is true.

2. In each iteration, the body of the loop is executed, and the loop variable (`count`) is updated (`count++`).

3. The loop prints "Iteration 1" to "Iteration 5" in this example.

## 2. Do-While Loop

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x = 5;

    // Example of a do-while loop
    do {
        printf("Value of x: %d\n", x);
        x--;
    } while (x > 0);

    return 0;
}
```

Explanation of the Program:

1. The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it ensures that the code block is executed at least once
   before checking the condition.

2. In this example, the loop prints the value of `x` and decrements it until `x` becomes 0.

3. Even if the initial condition is false, the code block executes at least once.

## Practical Tips

- Use the `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance.
- The `do-while` loop is suitable when you want to guarantee that the code block runs at least once.

Understanding and utilizing `while` and `do-while` loops provide flexibility in handling different looping scenarios in
C programming. If you have specific questions or if there are additional topics you'd like to explore, feel free to ask.
Happy coding!
