# Structures and Arrays

Combining structures with arrays in C allows you to manage collections of structured data efficiently. Let's explore how
to work with structures and arrays together:

## **Array of Structures**

- You can create an array of structures to represent a collection of related data.

    ```c
    struct Point {
        int x;
        int y;
    };

    struct Point pointsArray[5];
    ```

Here, `pointsArray` is an array of `Point` structures.

## **Initializing Array of Structures**

- You can initialize an array of structures during declaration.

    ```c
    struct Point pointsArray[] = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}};
    ```

This initializes an array of `Point` structures with specific values.

## **Accessing Array of Structures**

- Accessing elements in an array of structures involves using indices and the dot (`.`) operator.

    ```c
    pointsArray[0].x = 10;
    pointsArray[0].y = 20;
    ```

## **Looping Through Array of Structures**

- Use loops to iterate through an array of structures.

    ```c
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        printf("Point %d: (%d, %d)\n", i + 1, pointsArray[i].x, pointsArray[i].y);
    }
    ```

## **Array Within a Structure**

- You can have an array as a member of a structure.

    ```c
    struct Student {
        char name[50];
        int grades[3]; // Array of grades
    };

    struct Student student1;
    ```

## **Passing Array of Structures to Functions**

- You can pass an array of structures to functions for processing.

    ```c
    void displayPoints(struct Point arr[], int size) {
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            printf("Point %d: (%d, %d)\n", i + 1, arr[i].x, arr[i].y);
        }
    }
    ```

Call the function with `displayPoints(pointsArray, 5);`.

Arrays of structures provide a versatile way to handle complex data sets. They are especially useful when dealing with
collections of similar entities, such as a list of points in a 2D space or a group of students with grades.
