# Setting Up VSCode for Ubuntu

## Step 1: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Run the following commands to install VSCode:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install code
   ```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can launch VSCode from the Applications menu or by running `code` in the
   terminal.

## Step 2: Install C/C++ Extension

1. Open VSCode.

2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or using
   the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X`.

3. In the Extensions view search box, type "C/C++".

4. Install the extension provided by Microsoft.

## Step 3: Install a C Compiler

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Run the following command to install the build-essential package (includes GCC and other necessary tools):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential
   ```

## Step 4: Create a C File and Compile

1. Open VSCode.

2. Click on "File" > "New File" to create a new file.

3. Save the file with a `.c` extension, for example, `hello.c`.

4. Write your C code in the editor.

5. Open the terminal in VSCode.

6. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc hello.c -o hello
   ```

7. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```

## Step 5: Explore Other IDEs (Optional)

While VSCode is a great choice, you can explore alternative IDEs for C programming on Ubuntu:

- **Code::Blocks:** Install using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install codeblocks
  ```

- **Eclipse:** Install using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo snap install eclipse --classic
  ```

Choose an IDE that best suits your preferences.
