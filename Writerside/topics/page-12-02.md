# `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc`

In C programming, memory management plays a crucial role in creating flexible and efficient programs.
The `malloc`, `calloc`, and `realloc` functions are essential for dynamically allocating and resizing memory. This
section explores the usage of these functions, their differences, and best practices.

## **`malloc` - Allocating Memory**

- The `malloc` function allocates a specified number of bytes of memory and returns a pointer to the beginning of the
  allocated block.

    ```c
    int *dynamicArray = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
    ```

This example allocates memory for an integer array with a size of 5.

## **`calloc` - Allocating and Initializing Memory**

- The `calloc` function allocates a specified number of blocks of memory, each with a specified size. It initializes the
  memory to zero.

    ```c
    int *zeroedArray = (int *)calloc(5, sizeof(int));
    ```

Here, memory is allocated for an integer array of size 5, and each element is initialized to zero.

## **`realloc` - Resizing Memory**

- The `realloc` function is used to resize a previously allocated block of memory. It takes a pointer to the original
  block, the new size, and returns a pointer to the resized block.

    ```c
    int *resizedArray = (int *)realloc(dynamicArray, 10 * sizeof(int));
    ```

This example resizes the previously allocated `dynamicArray` to accommodate 10 integers.

## **Memory Deallocation**

- Proper memory deallocation is essential to prevent memory leaks. The `free` function is used to release the memory
  allocated by `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`.

    ```c
    free(dynamicArray);
    free(zeroedArray);
    ```

Always free dynamically allocated memory when it is no longer needed.

## **Choosing the Right Function**

- Use `malloc` when you need to allocate a block of memory without initializing its content. Use `calloc` when you want
  to allocate and initialize memory to zero. Use `realloc` when you need to resize a previously allocated block.

Understanding these memory allocation functions and their appropriate use is crucial for effective memory management and
avoiding common pitfalls in C programming.
